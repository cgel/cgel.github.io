My name is Carles Gelada and I'm a Google Brain Resident based in Montreal. Due to a chronic drone obsession I dropped out of high-school and studied math and programing on my own. I ended up focusing on deep learning and reinforcement learning, I attended NIPS 2016, got a couple of recommendation letters and go my current job at Google.
