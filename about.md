title: About
---
My name is Carles Gelada, I am 19 years old and I live in Girona, Spain.

I am passionate about AI and I am working tirelessly to solve it. For the last few years I have been
studying on my own, exploring my interests and working on cool projects. And, since a year and
a half ago I realized how interesting AI is, I have been fully focused on studying and researching
it.

My interests drive me, I need the freedom to explore and work on what I love. This is why I
decided that going to university was not the best path for me, even when considering the
limitations that doing this entails. Instead, I decided to study the many things I need to learn
while I also work on the research that motivates me.

I am now looking to join a research group where I can learn faster and where my contributions
can be more meaningful, where I can find people with a common interest in solving AI.
