In my town we have an annual festival called FADE Festival of Digital and Electronic Arts. There is music and a variety of tech-related artistic exhibitions. This year I had been doubting on what I was gonna present, untill I read the style transfer paper. Now the question was, how to showcase this to everybody in a fun and interactive way? Here is what I came up with.

pAInt is an installation that lets you select the style of an iconic painting in a tablet, takes a picture of you and then paints the content of that picture with the style of the selected painting.

The whole think was concocted in 2 days. And if you keep in mind that I had never build anything like this --a web app-- I think it turned up pretty good. It was done in python, pygame for the display and flask to serve and communicate with the tablet. To actually generate the images a lua implementation of style transfer or CNNMRF% was called.

Why two different methods? Because depending of the style image one works better than the other.

I also experimented with neural-doodle but the results were not that great and it was slower.

Depending of the method and particular style, painting would take between 1 to 2 minutes. Slow, but not slow enough for people lose interest.

The whole experience was pretty crazy. I spent all the previous day and night finishing it and finally saw it running in full just 30 minutes before it was intalled. It was a resounding success, painting non-stop and I was next to it, keeping it running and answering questions for the whole day. And to finish all then came the party.

If I had to do it again, there is a cupple of things I would do differently. Since the tablet is expensive and the installation not very intuitive someone had to be there at all times. Just Getting rid of the tablet and adding 4 physical buttons  <, O, >, return  and a good written down explanation would be enough to get it working without supervision. And I could go enjoy the festival :)

On a side note, I was asked a few times if I printed the paintings or if even if they were allwoed to take photos of the screen. So who knows, it might be possible to make a few buks.

Here I leave you with a few of my favourite paintings from that day.
