Points:
-The context (knowlage, communications, education etc) becomes the
 more important factor when determining intelligence as individual intelligence e.i.(brain size) grows
- Therefore this contex is the most precious thing we have and we should try to preserve it and potentiate it.
- Specialitzation generates a richer context
- Communication is crutial. Books and then the internet
- The amount of information on the genome is insignificant compared with the knowledge that a person can acquire, and
 this is insignificant with what a society can discover.
- Humanity is a kind of singularity
- Provably life itself is a kind of singularity too
- Explain what the singularity is
